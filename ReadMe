Changes to our Code from Object Design Document

//NOTE:
//While Coding, our team ran into struggles with implementation
//and realized that our UML could not fulfill
//the system's requirements. As such, there are some deviation
//from the UML and Object Design Document in our code
//We outlined the changes for each class in the UML below

Employee Class:
	-Removed the SwipeCard() Function
	-Replaced with returnCard() to return the Card
	
Manager Class:
-added returnAdminPass to return the manager's adminpass

Store Class:
-removed storeID and location from the UML Diagram, not needed
-added Arraylist of employees (employeelist)
-added Manager as a bidirectional relationship of the Store
-Added a simulation of database not shown in document
-added getCustomer,setcustomerCount, getMaxCustomers, and setMaxCustomers
-added AddEmployee in case of testing in StoreUI, not used in current code
-added a verifyManager and uses the man.console to verify an adminpass
-added a getManagerName to return the specific Store's Manager name. 

CentralSystem:
-Now composed of two cameras(CamIn & CamOut), replacing it with now a composition
-Composed of one CardReader and one Barrier
-Also composed with the Store class, so bidirectional relationship now
-Replaced updateCount with addCount and minusCount to account different camera's functions

Device:
-removed the Status String (originally planned to have an enum, removed it)

Barrier:
-added boolean method isOpen() to return barrier open/close status
